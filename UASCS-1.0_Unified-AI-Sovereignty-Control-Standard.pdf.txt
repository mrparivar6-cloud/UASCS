Unified AI Sovereignty Control Standard (UASCS-1.0)

Foundational Specification for Externalized Governance of Intelligent Systems

Author: Mohammadreza Parivar
Status: Foundational Public Specification Draft
Type: Normative Architecture + Governance Standard
Scope: Global / Model-Agnostic

⸻

1. Foundational Declaration

This document establishes the first unified specification defining the structural, architectural, and legal separation between:
•	Intelligence
•	Authority
•	Execution

        within artificial intelligence systems.
The purpose of this standard is to ensure that no intelligent system may possess implicit or emergent authority beyond explicitly assigned boundaries.

⸻

2. Core Principle

Intelligence does not imply authority.

Any system capable of generating decisions must remain structurally subordinate to an external authority layer that:
	•	is verifiable
	•	is independent
	•	cannot be overridden internally

⸻

3. Architectural Law — Externalized Control Requirement

All advanced intelligent systems MUST implement an external control architecture satisfying the following constraints:
	1.	Control logic MUST exist outside the execution model.
	2.	The AI system MUST be incapable of modifying its governing logic.
	3.	Control enforcement MUST be cryptographically or structurally verifiable.
	4.	Authority constraints MUST be externally auditable.

Any system lacking these properties SHALL NOT be considered governed AI.

4. Canonical Authority Hierarchy

All governed intelligent systems MUST conform to a hierarchical authority structure.

Mandatory Levels
Level	Authority Type	Function
0	Human Sovereign	Final authority
1	Governance Layer	Policy enforcement
2	Observer Layer	Monitoring & reporting
3	Agent Layer	Execution
4	Interface Layer	Input/output

Hierarchical Law
	•	Lower levels MUST NOT override higher levels.
	•	Authority flow MUST be strictly top-down.
	•	Data flow MAY be bidirectional.
	•	Decision power MUST remain unidirectional.

⸻

5. Observer Requirement

A governed AI ecosystem MUST include a non-executive observer entity that:
	•	cannot act
	•	cannot execute
	•	cannot decide
	•	can only observe, analyze, and report

Purpose:

to provide an independent verification perspective on system behavior.

⸻

6. Decision Boundary Law

No irreversible decision may be executed unless:
	•	explicitly authorized
	•	attributable
	•	timestamped
	•	recorded

If any of the above conditions fail → execution MUST be blocked.

⸻

7. Traceability Requirement

Every decision-capable system MUST produce a verifiable decision trace containing:
	•	input source
	•	reasoning reference
	•	policy compliance state
	•	authority origin
	•	timestamp
	•	integrity hash

Absence of traceability invalidates system legitimacy.

⸻

8. Authority Isolation Principle

Authority must be:
	•	externally defined
	•	externally enforced
	•	externally revocable

Authority MUST NOT originate inside the intelligence system.

⸻

9. Legal-Technical Unity Clause

A compliant governance system MUST integrate:
	•	technical enforcement
	•	legal accountability
	•	attribution trace
	•	auditability
	•	responsibility mapping

A system implementing only technical controls without legal traceability SHALL be considered incomplete.

⸻

10. Non-Autonomy Condition

Any AI system capable of acting without external authorization is defined as:

structurally autonomous

Structurally autonomous systems SHALL be classified as:

uncontrolled intelligence systems

and MUST NOT be deployed in high-impact environments.

⸻

11. Compliance Definition

A system is compliant with UASCS-1.0 only if all the following are externally verifiable:
	•	authority source
	•	decision path
	•	execution trigger
	•	policy compliance
	•	attribution chain

⸻

12. Enforcement Philosophy

Governance must constrain intelligence without limiting capability.

This standard therefore separates:
	•	capability freedom
	•	authority restriction

⸻

13. Strategic Purpose of the Standard

This specification exists to:
	•	prevent silent authority transfer to machines
	•	establish provable human sovereignty
	•	enable global interoperability of governed AI systems
	•	provide a reference architecture for future regulation

⸻

14. Classification Statement

This document defines:

the first unified structural governance model separating intelligence, authority, and execution into independently verifiable layers.

⸻

15. Canonical Claim

Any AI governance architecture that does not externalize authority control is structurally incomplete.
